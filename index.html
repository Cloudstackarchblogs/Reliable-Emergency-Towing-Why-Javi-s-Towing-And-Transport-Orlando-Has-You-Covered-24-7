                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Check Your Tires:</b> Worn-out or underinflated tires increase the risk of blowouts. Before long trips, inspect your tire pressure and tread depth. Replace tires that show signs of excessive wear.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Keep an Emergency Kit:</b> Having an emergency kit in your vehicle can make a big difference.
